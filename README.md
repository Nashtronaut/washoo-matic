# Washoo-matic

Washoo-matic is a small little side project to keep scores and stats on a backyard game some family members play. 

I built this app with Sveltekit and a supabase realtime back end to spectate games, and eventually store stats perpetually. 

I only spent a few days on this and did it in rush for a weekend coming up, so don't judge it too harshly!

I may make this available on the playstore in time. This is mostly a family joke, but it was a fun little project. In order to user, 
you will need to clone repo, open the `android` directory in `android studio` and build / compile and APK to side load to your device.

I have included some screenshots below

Cheers!
